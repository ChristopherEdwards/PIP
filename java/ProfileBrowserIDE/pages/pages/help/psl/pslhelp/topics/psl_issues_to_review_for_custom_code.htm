<h1>Issues to Review for Custom Code</h1>

<p>If using the PSL code generator in Profile v6.4 and Profile v7.0, review 
 the following items prior to writing custom code. These versions of PSL 
 are not backward compatible with the following classes, methods, etc.</p>

<p class=BodyTextBold>Record Class</p>

<p>The copy method previously accepted a parameter that would change the 
 mode of the record being copied to. The copy method creates a second version 
 of an instantiated record. In some cases, the new object will be filed 
 into the database with a different set of keys. For example, escrow account 
 creation copies the address record from the loan and saves it to the database 
 using its own account number. The required change is to remove the parameter 
 from the use of the method and add a second line of code that uses the 
 <a href="psl_record_setmode.htm">record.setMode</a> method.</p>

<p class=BodyTextBold>Row Class</p>

<p>Row columns that are named the same as one in the dep object will be 
 moved into that location. All others such as the XXX name must be manually 
 defined in the column Map parameter.</p>

<p class=BodyTextBold>Schema Class</p>

<p>The previous iteration of the <a href="psl_schema_createtable.htm">createTable</a> 
 method allowed the use of literals as a key. However, the quotes that 
 were required around the literals did not follow the industry standard 
 of “”literal”” since the keys were embedded within quotes. This has been 
 changed. The compiler now prints an error message when using the previous 
 literal format in the schema create.</p>

<p class=BodyTextBold>Db Class</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>The <a href="psl_db_isdefined.htm">Db.isDefined</a> 
 method cannot be used with tables that contain only one record (e.g., 
 Institution Variables table (CUVAR)), because the Db.isDefined method 
 requires keys. The code needs to be written to use <a href="psl_db_getrecord.htm">getRecord</a> 
 with a new third parameter, which does not throw an error if the record 
 does not exist.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>The Db.isDefined method 
 previously allowed the programmer to not quote the keys. This error has 
 been closed in this generation.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Previously, the compiler 
 ignored PSL code that contained an extra } or ). If the PSL code contains 
 an extra } or ), the compiler now reports an error during the compilation 
 process. This occurs in <a href="psl_db_select.htm">Db.select</a> and 
 <a href="psl_db_getonerow.htm">Db.getOneRow</a> coding.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>The getOneRow method was 
 rewritten to provide a better review of the keys supplied for the method. 
 If an incorrect number of keys was supplied before the change, the compiler 
 did not recognize it and the data retrieved was null. Due to the rewrite, 
 the compiler will throw an error if the method receives the wrong number 
 of keys to properly retrieve data. This method also previously accepted 
 the word ‘distinct’ as a column, but did not compile the code correctly 
 without warning. This situation will now throw an error.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class=BodyTextBold>Issues Unrelated to a Class</p>

<ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>Using $Get around a PSL 
 object was previously allowed, but the compiler threw it out. It is now 
 reported as an error.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p-CBullet1><p class=Bullet1>PSL cannot allow exclusive 
 new commands. The effect of their use is that the internal object array 
 is hidden. Even though the object pointer could be in the exclusive list, 
 the objects would not be. The compiler now throws an error when an exclusive 
 new is found in the code.</p></li>
