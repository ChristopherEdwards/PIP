<P CLASS="western">PIP provides a competitive relational / object

makes PIP exceptional is its level of control on the production

real-time core processing system for banks. PIP is mature because it
has been in production for many years, but until now it has only been
available as part of Profile – the code bases were intertwined.
Now, for the first time, the PIP code base has been separated from
the Profile code base and is separately released GPL software. The
Profile code base remains proprietary.</P>

<H3 CLASS="western">Accessing PIP</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Once the PIP virtual machine is booted, QEMU
provides a character-based console to the virtual machine. You can
connect to the virtual machine from this console. QEMU virtual
machines run as if they are on a protected local area network (LAN)
segment behind a firewall and proxy server on your host machine.
Outbound network access from a virtual machine is routed through a
virtual gateway that, on that LAN segment appears at address
10.0.2.2. The command line used to start up a virtual machine
specifies TCP ports on the host that are to be forwarded to ports on
the virtual machine. For “well known” ports, the suggested
command lines use different ports on the host and guest machines
(e.g., since port 22 on the host is likely to be used for ssh
sessions to the host, and is therefore an unsuitable port to forward
connections to port 22 on the virtual machine, port 2222 on the host
is used instead).</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">For greater flexibility (e.g., scrollable
	session log) and for additional character-based sessions, you can
	use a secure shell (ssh) client on your host, such as <A HREF="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" TARGET="_blank">putty</A>,

<H3 CLASS="western">Documentation</H3>
<P CLASS="western">In addition to the JDBC documentation, there is
online user documentation accessible via the browser IDE as well as

architecture is itself visible and can be manipulated through the

Limitations</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Although PIP's underlying engine is mature, the
separation from Profile and stand-alone packaging is brand new.
Bearing in mind the open source mantra of “release early, release
often”, we are making PIP available for the community to gain
experience with it even as we continue to refine it. Therefore:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western"><B>Separation of PIP from Profile:</B> There
	are known references to Profile, and potentially code and data that
	should belong with Profile that inadvertently remain with PIP. There
	are also likely cases where code and data that should belong with
	PIP inadvertently remain with Profile. For example, the table CUVAR

	There is not yet a clean separation of PIP code and data from that

	of PIP on a system, and multiple application development
	environments that share that one copy of PIP. At this time, a copy
	of PIP must exist for each separate application development
	environment. Also, when deploying applications developed with PIP,

Profile</A> is a tightly integrated real-time core processing system
which offers financial institutions premier transaction engine,
product factory, and information repository capabilities. Profile
eliminates many of the functional, informational, and delivery
boundaries that are traditionally found in many legacy banking
enterprise systems.</P>
<P CLASS="western">A core processing system is the legal system of
record for a bank, and its single most mission critical application.
Built on FIS PIP, Profile runs the largest real time core processing
system that is in daily production at any bank anywhere in the world
that we know of, and has recently been successfully benchmarked on an
x86_64 Linux platform on a database 50% larger than that largest live
system.</P>
<P CLASS="western">FIS Profile represents a new high standard of
market and customer responsiveness. Profile features a flexible
electronic manufacturing model — an innovative architecture that
enables the dynamic and efficient assembly of banking products,
instruments, and services from an extensive inventory of business
components. Thanks to its customer-centric design, the powerful
Profile service architecture and data model places customers at the
center of the information repository, thus enabling institutions to
offer true relationship banking.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Profile is the system of record for many tens of

<H2 CLASS="western">What is GT.M?</H2>
<P CLASS="western"><A HREF="http://www.fis-gtm.com/" TARGET="_blank">GT.M</A>

logical multi-site application configurations for unparalleled
continuity of business in the face of not only unplanned events (such
as unexpected system and site outages) as well as planned events
(such as system and application software upgrades, and even most
upgrades that involve a database schema change). In addition to being
the platform for most Profile deployments, GT.M is also increasingly
used in other industries such as health care, and is entrusted with
the bank balances and medical records of millions of people. GT.M
